# WhatShouldIEat-
A website dedicated to helping you find out what you should be eating when you don't have any ideas. 

This project's focus is on not using any front end frameworks and getting familiar with bootstrap and JQuery

What is used:

GMAPS places API 
Boostrap v4 alpha 4
JQuery 3


HOW TO USE:

Turn on location services for automatic loading of nearby places, if not search via zip code. one place is automatically selected from the list of 
results. That is the winner.
